Ever wondered how are you able to speak and write some languages while not understand the others. How some people can drive vehicles and some people cannot. This is because we learned it. Right from birth every living species on this planet acquire knowledge or skills through study, experience or being taught; that is we learn. We apply these knowledge or skill-set acquired to get a favourable outcome in future.

But we human beings have some limitations. We are bounded by time. So to overcome this constraint we teach machines and This art of teaching machines to get a quick and favourable outcome is known as "machine learning".

Here at Turing Chapter, our innovative minds find out the different ways we can use machine learning to solve our real life problems effectively and efficiently.
