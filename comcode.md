Wikipedia says "Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications."

The main aim of the club is to create a platform for the ones who have a knack in competitive coding where they can discuss problems, algorithms and other related stuff. Other than that, we organize tutorial sessions and online algorithmic competitions.
